# Ball_game-Scripts

The Ball_game-Scripts project is an extension of a Solar System project, which now includes an opening scene with a scene loader functionality. This allows the original project scene to be loaded seamlessly from the opening scene using the Unity SceneManager.

# Project Description
The Ball_game-Scripts project consists of scripts and scenes related to the Solar System project, with the addition of an opening scene and a scene loader functionality.

# Opening Scene
An opening scene has been created as the initial scene when the game is launched. This scene serves as an introduction or menu screen for the game.

# Scene Loader
The SceneLoader script is responsible for loading the original project scene from the opening scene. It utilizes the Unity SceneManager to load the desired scene seamlessly. The script is attached to an object in the opening scene that triggers the scene transition.

Utilizing the Unity SceneManager to load scenes
